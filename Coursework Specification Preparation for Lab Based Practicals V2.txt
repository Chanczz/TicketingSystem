Elaborated Guide to Implementing the Real-Time Event Ticketing System with Producer-Consumer Pattern
Introduction
This guide aims to provide a detailed explanation of how to implement each component of the Real-Time Event Ticketing System as per the coursework specification. The focus is on utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the Producer-Consumer pattern to simulate a dynamic ticketing environment. The system should handle concurrent ticket releases and purchases while maintaining data integrity.

1. Understanding the Project Requirements
Before diving into the implementation, ensure you thoroughly understand the project requirements:
· Objective: Create a real-time ticketing system that handles concurrent ticket releases (by vendors) and purchases (by customers) using multi-threading and synchronization.
· Must-Haves:
o Concurrency handling with multiple producers and consumers.
o Data integrity in a multi-threaded environment.
o Basic reporting features.
· Technology Stack:
o Frontend: JavaFX, React.js, or Angular.
o Backend: Java, Node.js, or Spring Boot.
· Restrictions:
o All GUI components must be manually coded—no drag-and-drop tools or code generators.
o Focus on core concepts suitable for second-year undergraduate students.

2. Choosing the Technology Stack
Frontend Choices:
· JavaFX: Suitable if you prefer Java and want to create desktop applications with a GUI.
· React.js or Angular: Ideal for web-based applications. Use if you are comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript and web development.
Backend Choices:
· Java: Good for an all-Java solution, especially if using JavaFX for the frontend.
· Node.js: Use if you prefer JavaScript on the backend, which pairs well with React.js or Angular.
· Spring Boot: If you have experience with Java and want to use a framework that simplifies backend development.
Recommendation: Choose the technologies you are most comfortable with and that align with your coursework or future career interests.
